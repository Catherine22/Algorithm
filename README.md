Algorithms
===================


## Sorting
- [Bubble Sort]    
- [Insertion Sort]
- [Merge Sort]
- Quick sort
- Selection sort

## Simulate Turing Machine
  - [1 + a positive integer]

## [Sequence]
  - 2 ways to increase the capacity.

> **Note:**
> - increaseArray()
>  - However, in the worst cast, It takes O(n) to increase the capacity of a vector by one.
>Space utilization is always 100%.
> - doubleArray()
>  - If you double the capacity each time, you might get lower space utilization (the lowest is 50%), but it only takes O(1).
> - Double the capacity is more efficient. In general, it's better.

  - Insert/remove/find a element
